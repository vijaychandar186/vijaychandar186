- **Entity Recognition Pipeline with Tesseract and Deepset MiniLM**  
  Built a pipeline using fine-tuned Tesseract OCR and Deepset’s MiniLM-uncased-squad2 model on a synthetic dataset to extract QA results from receipts as JSON key-value pairs.  
- **FP16 Quantization and ONNX Runtime Optimization**  
  Implemented FP16 quantization and ONNX runtime adaptations for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices, enabling deployment in diverse runtimes.  
- **Table Transformer Pipeline for Document Processing**  
  Fine-tuned a DETR-based Table Transformer for table detection and structure recognition. Deployed a serverless pipeline using AWS Lambda for OCR, table extraction, and Excel conversion, optimized for scalability.  
- **Qwen2-VL-7B Fine-Tuning for Structured Data Extraction**  
  Fine-tuned Qwen2-VL-7B on a client’s dataset using function calling to extract structured content from unstructured data. Deployed as an inference endpoint on AWS SageMaker.  
- **Eye Strain Monitoring Browser Extension**  
  Developed a Chrome/Edge extension using OpenCV and Python/JS to monitor screen proximity and blink rates, generating custom reports with actionable feedback.  
- **LLM Prompt Engineering and RAG Pipeline**  
  Engineered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with fine-tuned LLMs (using Pinecone, LangChain, and Gemini API) for internal documentation and QA tailored to client requirements.  
- **Chat Application with Cohere and OpenAI APIs**  
  Built a customizable chat application using Next.js, FastAPI, LlamaIndex, and LlamaParse, integrating Cohere and OpenAI APIs for enhanced NLP capabilities.  
- **OCR SaaS Application**  
  Developed a scalable OCR SaaS app using Next.js (App Router), Tesseract OCR, Tailwind CSS, Docker Compose, Razorpay, and tRPC for seamless document processing and payment integration.
